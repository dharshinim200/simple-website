<h1 class="head">What is Environmental Awareness?</h1>

<p class="para"> Is necessary to comprehend the environmental movement before we can define environmental consciousness.
An concept known as environmentalism emphasizes that humans have a duty to respect, safeguard, and 
preserve the natural world from human-caused harm.</p>

<h1 class="head">How to Promote Environmental Awareness?</h1>
<ul class="list">
<li> It is imperative that you ensure that you have a solid understanding of environmental issues before you start 
    encouraging environmental consciousness in your community. Read books and other resources, stay informed about
     environmental news, and become knowledgeable about the problems that your neighborhood is facing. Having taken 
    the effort to educate yourself, it will be much easier to discuss environmental issues with others.</li>

<li>Online courses, informative and motivational seminars, books, articles, films, brochures, and group 
    learning—both inside and outside of the classroom—are just a few of the tools that may be used to further 
    environmental education and awareness. These are only a handful of the resources that can help you begin spreading 
    environmental consciousness.
    </li>
<li>Selecting the environmental issue that most urgently appeals to you is a wise move that will guarantee your 
    continuous involvement. Even if there are countless environmental challenges, it's simple to become overwhelmed by 
    them all, despite their importance. Consider concentrating on just one problem at a time. You'll quickly realize how 
    connected all environmental concerns are, and you'll identify your area of interest.</li></ul>

<li>Drought with water shortages and increased wildfires</li>
<li>Rising sea levels with flooding</li>
<li>Destruction of coral reefs</li>
